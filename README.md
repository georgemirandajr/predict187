# predict187

This project repo is intended to share the methods used to identify potential murderers within a probationer population. Someone wanting to reproduce my results should begin with the trainModel.R script and use the provided datasets. The aps.rds dataset has been cleaned, anonymized and even partitioned for data modelling into the train.rds and test.rds files.
